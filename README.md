## Description
EI | KON is a character builder for the tabletop role-playing game ICON (https://massif-press.itch.io/icon). It features local storage for characters for use in the tactical combat of ICON. Every class has been implemented with a robust character sheet page for tracking available actions and features during a turn.

This app was built as a solo final project for an HCI class UPenn. I made it as a labor of love for TTRPG systems and as someone who is morbidly interested in virtual aspects of modern tabletop games.

Feel free to peruse the following page: [https://ei-kon.vercel.app/about/reflection] for a walkthrough and reflections on designing this app!
